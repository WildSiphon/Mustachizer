## <img src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4a1.png" alt="bulb" style="zoom:33%;" /> The Idea

The idea behind his project was to propose a solution to **mustachize as many faces as possible**. So we did it! 
And because it's funny and we like to share, we made it a twitter bot ([@RealStachBot](https://twitter.com/RealStachBot)) and a discord bot.

### Twitter use

[@RealStachBot](https://twitter.com/RealStachBot) is already on twitter. If you want it to mustachize something, just tag it :

+ When you **post** a picture
+ In the **reply** of someone's picture

The bot doesn't mustachize when you tag it in a quote RT of a tweet with media.

You can publish your own bot based on our work if, and only if, <u>it brings something different to Twitter</u>. Otherwise make a pull request.
If you publish your own bot based on our work, please <u>link the project and our bot in the account description</u>.

### Discord use

We published the code for a discord bot but didn't make one public.
Feel free to use our project for personal use only, but <u>don't make a public bot with it</u>.

Now that all the script kiddies are trying to mustachize some stuff without reading more, we can talk about how the code works with y'all real mustache growers.

//Stuff with debug pictures and more
